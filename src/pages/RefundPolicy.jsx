In case you have attempted to make an online payment for a transaction more than once, and PSFPL has received the amount more than once, PSFPL reserves the right to adjust it against additional EMI towards your loan account. If PSFPL decides to refund the excess amount, it will be made through cheque within 1 month of the claim.
